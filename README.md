StargatePullToRefresh
=====================

Pull to refresh with a Stargate.

Some nice little rendering of the gate from Stargate when you pull to refresh.

Some interesting tidbits:

- Has all 9 chevrons
- Gate address is random upon creation of the gate layer
- The inner items will correctly rotate and dial to the correct address symbol
